## Project name: 
    - Ultimate Media Explorer

## Short app description
    - The app lets users search movies, songs, and books, compare them side-by-side, and discover similar content using static datasets stored in a relational database. The app also stores detailed information about each piece of media, such as ratings, genres, release year, and creators. Users can view summaries of items, explore related titles, and identify similarities across different media types. By unifying movies, songs, and books under one system, the app provides a centralized hub for media exploration, making it easy to analyze trends, compare metadata, and discover new content based on personal preferences.
